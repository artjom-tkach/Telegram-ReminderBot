# Telegram-ReminderBot

The bot will help you remember information once and for all.

The forgetting curve can be broken by repeating information at set intervals.

Let's say you've learned a few English words.
As soon as you close the notebook, the forgetting process will start.
How can I stop it? To repeat! But not chaotically, but strictly according to the scheme described in the bot.

Repetitions serve to break the forgetting curve. And once well-learned material will save your energy forever.
